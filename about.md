## I've kinda given up on life as we know it. 

It's not as bad as it sounds. 

**First, I've accepted uniqueness.** I'm no better or worse than any other human being, but I have a lived experience that doesn't match most established patterns. 

Gather all of the world's anarchopacifist vegetarians, and then filter for those who have a black american lived experience, have traveled extensively and lived abroad, learned other languages, work in tech (with two IPOs celebrated), live without alcohol or recreational substances, and have a unorthodox framework for their traditional partner relationship... you would have done one of two things: 

- left me all alone in a very large room 
- found the community I've been unsuccessfully looking for.

So I've given up on the idea that I'll fit in, I've stopped trying so hard to belong, and I've given a lot more attention to understanding who I am rather than to finding others who understand me. But that's just one side of giving up on life.

**I also feel deeply that life is about to change.** And I mean CHANGE--in tremendous, unimaginable ways. In a world where 

- there are now generations of digitally native individuals, who have only ever known a world with the near-instant transfer of data and information
- one may have unprecedented access and visibility into ourselves, our community and the world, 
- it is increasingly trivial to edit, remix, modify, copy and clip

we are now introducing not only unfathomable technological speed of processing but probabilistic method, machine learning, large language models and other artificial intelligence. 

> And that means that life, as we know it, is either basically done forever or will require more effort to salvage and maintain than the value it will provide in the very near future. 

*A very real belief that is growing in me, birthed by these two ideas, is that the logical thing for me to do is to identify the things that I want, find new an innovative ways to make them possible that align with our burgeoning reality, and then build a "life" that works for me.* No longer constrained by the cost and burden--rather challenged by it--it makes sense to just construct a life for one. Not to be alone, but to ensure a bespoke personal in most every interaction and experience. The days of sitting by the radio hoping to hear your favorite song are long gone, and I would suggest the days of hoping for society to play your tune are just as numbered. 

**Here's my tune, the one I craft with my own hands:**
- This place is a waypoint in the a world, a flag in undiscovered territory
- From this place I establish my settlement, like [Jean Baptiste Point du Sable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baptiste_Point_du_Sable) on the banks of the river, built with my hands and being what legacy I may have
- I want to be with my friends, so I will make a place where any friend can be with me, from anywhere, at any time
- And I will send a testament to the future, my message in a bottle, so that I can be remembered by my own voice.

This is Leftsider's third iteration. Where the first was a static site I built by hand, and the second was a blog I maintained for decades, this third iteration is my digital residence.
