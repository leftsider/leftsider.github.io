        <p class="content-paragraph content-paragraph--intro">
          Let's start with this: <em>I have no idea what a discord server is
          supposed to be.</em>
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          I didn't create this to emulate something that already exists: I
          created this with the intention of creating a place where I can be
          with my friends. And more than that: to share <em>myself</em> with my
          friends. As a server member this means I consider you a friend, and I want to share this
          place with you.
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          <strong>Think of this as my home.</strong> If you have been to my
          physical home, you will know that when I invite you into that place
          it is a heartfelt gesture. A gesture that appreciates—maybe even
          expects—a certain amount of respect and appreciation in return. I
          will not go so far as to say that coming into my house is an honor,
          but I will stand on treating my house as a place that has value. Not
          only the place itself, but the contents therein.
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          And so with this discord, all I ask is that you don't act any
          differently here than you would in my house.
        </p>

        <ul class="list list--guidelines">
          <li class="list-item">
            <em>Don't be rude to other people I've invited.</em>
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <em>If you need to make a mess, take it outside.</em>
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            <em>The rooms I've created are important to me; don't use them as
            if they were made for you.</em>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          If there are any questions, or if there's anything you'd like to do,
          seek me for guidance. I'm more than likely happy to help you figure
          out what you want to do. Because I like to be a gracious host,
          particularly because I only host people who I hold in high regard and
          esteem.
        </p>

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          At the end of the day, my online existence has always been about
          three things: <strong>honesty, craftsmanship, and good intent</strong>.
          I believe that these three things are the only things worth being
          proud of, and I am fiercely proud of the friends that I have, the
          interests that I have acquired and the things that I build.
