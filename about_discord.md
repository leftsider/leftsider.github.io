# About the Leftsider Discord

Let's start with this: I have no idea what a discord server is supposed to be.

I didn't create this to emulate something that already exists: I created this with the intention of creating a place where I can be with my friends. And more than that: to share *myself* with my friends. This means I consider you a friend, and i want to share this place with you.

**Think of this as my home.** If you have been to my physical home, you will know that when I invite you into that place it is a heartfelt gesture. A gesture that appreciates--maybe even expects--a certain  amount of respect and appreciation in return. I will not go so far as to say that coming into my house is an honor, but I will stand on treating my house as a place that has value. Not only the place itself, but the contents therein. 

And so with this discord, all I ask is that you don't act any differently here than you would in my house.  

- *Don't be rude to other people I've invited.*
- *If you need to make a mess, take it outside.* 
- *The rooms I've created are important to me; don't use them as if they were made for you.* 

If there are any questions, or if there's anything you'd like to do , seek me for guidance. I'm more than likely happy to help you figure out what you want to do. Because I like to be a gracious host, particularly because I only host people who I hold in high regard and esteem.

At the end of the day , my online existence has always been about three things: **honesty, craftsmanship, and good intent**. I believe that these three things are the only things worth being proud of, and I am fiercely proud of the friends that I have, the interests that I have acquired and the things that I build. 

### I hope you enjoy!
