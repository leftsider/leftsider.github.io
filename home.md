leftsider basis and logic

I've kinda given up on life as we know it. It's not as bad as it sounds. 

First, I've accepted that I'm a unique individual. I'm no better or worse than any other human being, but I have a lived experience that doesnt' match any established pattern. If you were to gather all of the world's anarchopacifist vegetarians, and then filtered for those who have a black american lived experience, have lived abroad and learned other languages, work in tech and have celebrated two IPOs, and maintains a non-traditional relationship status, you would have done one of two things: you would have either left me alone in a room or you would have helped me find the community I've been looking for, unsuccessfully. 

So I've given up on the idea that I'll fit in, I've stopped trying so hard to belong, and I've given a lot more attention to being who I am rather than to finding others who understand me. But that's just one side of giving up on life.

I also feel deeply that life is about to change. In tremendous, unimaginable ways. In a world that now has generations of digitally native individuals, who have only ever known a world with the near-instant transfer of data and information--a world where we have unprecedented access and visibility into ourselves, our community and the world, and a world where it is increasingly trivial to edit, remix, modify, copy and clip--we are now introducing not only unfathomable technological speed of processing but machine learning, probabalistic data modeling, large language models and other artificial intelligence. 

And that means that life, as we know it, is either basically done or more effort to salvage and maintain than the value it will provide in the very near future. 

A very real belief that is growing in me, birthed by these two ideas, is that the logical thing for me to do is to identify the things that I want, find new an innovative ways to make them possible that align with our burgeoning reality, and then build a "life" that works for me. No longer constrained by the cost and burden--rather challenged by it--it makes sense to just construct a life for one. Not to be alone, but to ensure personal in every interaction and experience. The days of sitting by the radio hoping to hear your favorite song are long gone, and I would suggest the days of hoping for society to play your tune are just as numbered. 

Here's my tune, the one I craft with my own hands:
- This place is a waypoint in the new world, a flag in undiscovered territory
- From this place I establish my settlement, like Dubois on the banks of the river, built with my hands and being my legacy
- I want to be with my friends, so I will make a place where any friend can be with me
- And I will send a testament to the future, my message in a bottle, so that I can be remembered by my own voice.

This is Leftsider3.0. Where 1.0 was a static site I built by hand and 2.0 was a blog I maintained for decades, 3.0 will be my digital life
